This is a combination of getty, login, startx, and xinit for use on
Linux console. While it is possible to use those directly, a single
executable is simpler and can do a few extra things to require less
typing during login.

Features:

- A curses-based login prompt. A nice thing to have for those of use who
  do not want to use xdm but find getty a little bare.
- Remembers last login name so you don't have to type it every time. In
  the login dialog press tab, up, or down, to cycle through available
  usernames. Very convenient on a family PC where security is not tight.
- Will launch X if you have ~/.xinitrc or your login shell otherwise. If
  root does not have xinitrc, you'll be able to login when X is broken.

Installation:

./configure && make install

Use it like you would getty. The command is "loginx tty1", and you'd add
it to inittab, somewhere in rc.d, in a copy of systemd's getty@.service,
or whatever correct location your distribution's init system requires.
